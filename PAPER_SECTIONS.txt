Abstract—This work introduces a three-layer video encryption framework that 
integrates cryptographic security, selective biometric protection, and 
integrity verification to address privacy concerns in video surveillance 
and streaming applications. The system implements a hierarchical security 
architecture: the first layer applies AES-256 in counter mode to encrypt 
entire video frames, establishing baseline confidentiality across all 
content; the second layer adds XOR encryption exclusively to detected face 
regions, providing enhanced protection for sensitive biometric data; and 
the third layer employs RSA-2048 digital signatures to guarantee frame 
integrity and authenticity. This graduated approach concentrates 
computational resources where privacy risks are highest while maintaining 
efficient processing for non-sensitive areas. The framework incorporates 
multi-method face detection combining Haar cascades, deep neural networks, 
and profile recognition to ensure comprehensive coverage across varied poses 
and lighting conditions. Per-frame key derivation using HKDF prevents 
pattern exploitation across the video stream, with unique cryptographic 
keys generated for each frame. Experimental results demonstrate lossless 
reconstruction (MSE = 0, PSNR = ∞) alongside strong cryptographic properties 
(NPCR = 99.61%, UACI = 33.69%), confirming effective diffusion and confusion. 
The system achieves 100% signature verification rate, processing video at 
10-15 frames per second on standard hardware, with decryption operations 
completing 4.7 times faster than encryption. Unlike two-layer approaches 
that address only encryption or only integrity, our three-layer methodology 
unifies confidentiality, selective reinforcement, and authentication in a 
single framework, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive surveillance 
systems, secure video platforms, and applications requiring both content 
protection and tamper detection.

[INTRODUCTION SECTION]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. INTRODUCTION

   Digital video has become ubiquitous in modern society, powering 
applications from surveillance systems and video conferencing to streaming 
platforms and medical imaging. However, this widespread adoption brings 
significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the protection of 
biometric information captured in video streams. Facial data, being highly 
sensitive and personally identifiable, requires robust security measures 
that go beyond traditional content protection mechanisms. Recent privacy 
regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have heightened the legal requirements 
for protecting personal information in video content, making effective 
video encryption not just a technical challenge but a compliance necessity.

   Existing video encryption approaches typically fall into two categories: 
uniform full-frame encryption and selective region-of-interest encryption. 
Uniform encryption applies the same cryptographic operations across all 
frame content, treating background scenery with the same security priority 
as sensitive facial features. While this provides comprehensive protection, 
it demands substantial computational resources and often conflicts with 
real-time processing requirements in surveillance and streaming 
applications. Selective encryption attempts to address efficiency concerns 
by encrypting only sensitive regions, but this leaves non-encrypted areas 
vulnerable to reconstruction attacks and fails to provide baseline security 
guarantees for the entire content. Furthermore, most existing systems lack 
integrated integrity verification mechanisms, making tampered frames 
indistinguishable from authentic ones.

   This work addresses these limitations through a three-layer video 
encryption framework that unifies confidentiality, selective biometric 
protection, and integrity verification in a single cohesive system. Our 
approach recognizes that different components of video content have varying 
security requirements and implements a graduated protection strategy 
accordingly. The first layer establishes baseline confidentiality by 
applying AES-256 in counter mode to entire video frames, ensuring that all 
content—whether sensitive or not—receives fundamental cryptographic 
protection. The second layer then applies additional XOR encryption 
specifically to detected facial regions, concentrating enhanced protection 
where privacy risks are highest. This selective reinforcement provides 
double encryption for biometric data without the computational overhead of 
applying maximum-strength encryption uniformly. The third layer employs 
RSA-2048 digital signatures to guarantee frame integrity and authenticity, 
enabling tamper detection and source verification—capabilities often absent 
in pure encryption schemes.

   The system incorporates several technical innovations to ensure practical 
effectiveness. Multi-method face detection combining Haar cascades, deep 
neural networks, and profile recognition provides robust identification of 
facial regions across varied poses, lighting conditions, and partial 
occlusions. Per-frame key derivation using HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation 
Function) generates unique cryptographic keys for each frame from master 
secrets, preventing correlation attacks across the video stream. This 
frame-level independence ensures that compromising a single frame's keys 
does not jeopardize the security of other frames.

   The principal contributions of this work are:

   1) A novel three-layer video encryption architecture that integrates 
      full-frame AES-256-CTR encryption, selective XOR reinforcement on 
      face regions, and RSA-2048 digital signatures in a unified framework, 
      addressing confidentiality, selective protection, and integrity 
      requirements simultaneously;

   2) A privacy-aware hierarchical protection mechanism that applies 
      graduated security levels based on content sensitivity, providing 
      double encryption (AES + XOR) for facial regions while maintaining 
      efficient single-layer protection for non-sensitive areas;

   3) A comprehensive multi-method face detection pipeline combining 
      classical and deep learning approaches to ensure robust biometric 
      region identification across diverse real-world conditions;

   4) Per-frame cryptographic independence through HKDF-based key 
      derivation that prevents pattern exploitation and correlation attacks 
      across video sequences;

   5) Experimental validation demonstrating lossless reconstruction 
      (MSE = 0, PSNR = ∞) with strong cryptographic properties (NPCR = 
      99.61%, UACI = 33.69%) and 100% signature verification rate, 
      confirming both security effectiveness and practical viability at 
      10-15 FPS processing speed.

   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews 
related work in video encryption, selective encryption methods, and face 
privacy preservation techniques, positioning our contributions within the 
existing literature. Section III presents the proposed three-layer 
encryption framework, detailing the architecture, cryptographic operations, 
face detection methodology, and key derivation mechanisms. Section IV 
describes the implementation details, including development environment, 
algorithmic choices, and performance optimizations. Section V presents 
comprehensive experimental results covering security analysis through NPCR, 
UACI, MSE, and PSNR metrics, performance evaluation including processing 
speed and computational overhead, and comparative analysis with state-of-
the-art approaches. Section VI discusses design trade-offs, scalability 
considerations, and application scenarios. Finally, Section VII concludes 
the paper and outlines directions for future research.
